# ACHIEVEMENT MANAGER



## What does this project do?
This project is for the management of things to achieve.
We can use this project to manage the todo list, bucket list, and life goals.

## Why is this project useful?
Every time, we have things to do. 

It could be the short-term goals or long-term goals.
If we can see the whole list of them, it could be more helpful to achieve them.

So I made this project to make it more easy to achieve our goals.
I distributed goals to three category -> todo list, bucket list, and life goal.

We can create and delete the new goals easily.
The time is marked when we create and complete it, so we are able to know how long it took to achieve.
Also, we can write the description of that goal. You can use it to write down the progress of that goal.
